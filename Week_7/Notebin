Project quality management.
In project management, quality isn’t the same as perfection. It’s not practical to spend the time and resources to take a project to perfection — and in many cases, that’s not even attainable. The goal of project quality management is to achieve consistency across your projects.
Completing a project on time is one thing — but completing it to a high standard of work is arguably more important. Project quality management allows you to make sure what you deliver meets with client approval.
